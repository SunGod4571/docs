title: What are FastFlags?
description: A guide to FastFlags in Roblox.
---

## IMPORTANT!

FFlags work only in roblox studio
and theres a small list of allowed fflags that players can use:
[on the Devforum.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569)

## What are FastFlags used for?

They toggle new features, optimizations, or experimental updates on Roblox.
They can either apply to the client or server

## Guide

To add FFlags you need to open Fishstrap --> FastFlags then click on "FastFlag editor"

Here you can see your preset fflags (If you have any)
Or you can add new ones by clicking "Add new" and either type the fflags or if you have multiple fflags you can add them all at once by clicking on "Import JSON"

Example (for manual adding): "FFlagHandleAltEnterFullscreenManually" "True" or if you want to disable you type "False"
